# Magic 2019 Conference

## OpenAPI Your Gateway to Digitial Transformation by Wim Jongman
In this talk Wim Jongman will show you how easy it is to call an RPG program from a web request.

Presentation and example source code is in the repository. This talk uses data from the following link[1] which may be dead by the time you read this. The contents of the link is therefore saved. See instructions.MD on how to setup the CGi call to the RPG.

## Magic box test
The service might still be running on the magic box. Try the following links

* http://magic.magic-ug.org:81/rpgdemo.html (this link provides a form which will pass the data to the RPG program)
